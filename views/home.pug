            p This Website provides Super Simple and Quick Discord Notifications for your Stream going live.

            p We limit you to only Notifying One Discord for the Twitch ID you log in as. Mostly for Service health and efficent use of the Twitch API.

            p This is an Open Source project, covered under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/" target="wtfpl">WTFPL Licence</a> (aka Do What the F**k You want), you can review the source code at <a href="https://github.com/BarryCarlyon/twitch_discord_barrycarlyon_co_uk" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
