            p This Website provides Super Simple and Quick Discord Notifications for your Stream going live.

            p We limit you to only Notifying One Discord for the Twitch ID you log in as. Mostly for Service health and efficent use of the Twitch API.

            p This is an Open Source project, covered under the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/" target="wtfpl">WTFPL Licence</a> (aka Do What the F**k You want), you can review the source code at <a href="https://github.com/BarryCarlyon/twitch_discord_barrycarlyon_co_uk" target="_blank">GitHub</a>

                h3 Quick Start

                p This tool lets the <strong>Twitch Channel Owner</strong> <strong>only</strong> setup the "Twitch to Discord Notification".
                p As to use EventSub for zero cost requires permission from the <i>Twitch Channel Owner</i>.
                p So the <strong>Twitch Channel Owner</strong> will need to Login, then click "<strong>Link a Discord</strong>"
                p And that is it.
                p There is a test button to send a "test" notification to check the right Discord Channel is selected, which will the self delete that test message after.
